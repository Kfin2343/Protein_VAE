The code in this project is based off of code written by 
Xinqiang Ding for "Deciphering protein evolution and fitness 
landscapes with latent space models" (https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13633-0) 
while working in the Brooks lab at University of Michigan. For the 
original repository, see Github.com/xqding/PEVAE_Paper.

The branches in this repository aim to expand upon Xinqiang Ding's work
by current members of the Brooks group. Expansions focus on finding more 
Evolutionary and functional relationships in the latent space, as well
as the effect of different neural network architectures on the model.
